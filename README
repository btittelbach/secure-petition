HTML-Form submission code and DB scheme for storing petition data in a secure way

Basically the idea is to encrypt submitted e-mails asymetrically, so your e-mail list cannot be stolen and your supporters e-mails and personal data are protected


============================
   Required PHP Features
============================

* openssl
* mcrypt
* filter
* PECL: yaml
* PECL: pecl-html

============================
   SETUP
============================

1. make sure you have PHP >= 5.2 and above extensions installed
2. put the php files wherever you can best integrate them into your existing file structure
3. create a form like example_form (in your static html files/wiki/CMS) that submits to submit.php
   (submit.php may be renamed)
4. use "php generate_keypair.php" to generate a public an private key
6. store the private key securely away from the database, leave the public key next to the php files
7. edit config.php and place it in the same dir as submit.php and verify_email.php
8. check that all file and URI paths are correct in config.php
9. create all missing .html files configured in config.php

==========
   TODO
==========

* verify that decryption actually works
* set "already submitted Name X Y" Cookie against accidental resubmission ??
* support required fields
